**Process report**  
Tasks were not too hard to accomplish although in some cases I felt either the table or the graph were enough to visualize information. Yet, it was a very useful
exercise and I believe I have a good cheatsheet for dplyr and ggplot, complimented by external resources. My last task was an analisis of variance 
to compare the life expectancies of four countries in latin america, I did an exploratory plot but ran out of time to produced the typical plot
to show anova results (means and error bars), hopefully I can do it in another assignment.
