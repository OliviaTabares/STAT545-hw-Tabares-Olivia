**Process Report**

The reshape assignment went smoothly and it allowed me to understand how changing the shape of a data frame can facilitate visualization of information or is prefered for making plots  
As for the join assingment, I spent too much time figuring out what sort of complementary data frame I should build in order to render joined data frames useful to explain the joins. At first, every dataframe looked the same as I was not adding a different element, just making more columns that could be attached to the original data frame. Due to this, I ran out of time and was not able to explain the joins in my own words but referenced a very useful cheatsheet.
