**Process Report**  
 I found this assignment a bit tiresome but I understand the need of managing factors for better data visualization. My graph skills are improving but there are still a lot of graphs that I haven't tried such as area plots or plots with confidence intervals, this time I tried a side-by-side boxplot with emmbeded mean lines.
 Through this class I learned a set of tools that make my work with R much more efficient, and by using github reproducible as well. Thanks STAT545 teaching team
